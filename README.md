## Installation Instructions

Follow these simple steps to install the cursor pack on your Windows PC.

### Step 1: Extract the Files
Make sure all the files, including the `.cur` and `.ani` files, and the `Install.inf` file, are extracted into a single folder.

### Step 2: Run the Installer
1.  Locate the `Install.inf` file in the folder.
2.  Right-click on `Install.inf`.
3.  From the context menu, select **"Install"**.

This will automatically copy the cursor files to the correct Windows directory and create a new cursor scheme in your system settings. You may see a User Account Control (UAC) prompt asking for permission to make changes. Click "Yes" to continue.

### Step 3: Apply the Cursor Scheme
1.  Go to **"Start"** > **"Settings"** > **"Bluetooth & devices"** > **"Mouse"**.
2.  Click on **"Additional mouse settings"**. This will open the classic Mouse Properties window.
3.  Navigate to the **"Pointers"** tab.
4.  Under the **"Scheme"** drop-down menu, you should now see **"MacOS Cursor"**.
5.  Select **"MacOS Cursor"** from the list.
6.  Click **"Apply"** and then **"OK"** to save your changes.

Your new cursor pack is now active!

## Troubleshooting

If the "MacOS Cursor" scheme does not appear in the list after installation:
1.  Restart your computer. Sometimes, a reboot is necessary for the changes to take effect.
2.  Double-check that you right-clicked and selected "Install" on the correct `Install.inf` file.
3.  Ensure that all the cursor files and the `Install.inf` are in the same folder.
